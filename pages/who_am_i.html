            <p>My name is Lucas Ezequiel Mislej, I was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1999. I define myself as an obsessive of perfection, I am looking at the minimal details of all stages of my life searching for an upgrade of performance or simplicity.
            All my life since I was a child I like the competition, serching for reaching the best my body and mind can do.</p>

            <p> a volleyball player I started to play in 2010, with only 10 years, been influenciated by my dad, who had play the sport a lot of years before I was born.</p>

            <p>By the years, I was playing differents roles in volleyball, but now after long years of preparation, I can say I am a solid <strong>opositte spiker</strong>, with a low margin of error and very good second line spike</p> 

            <p> my personal life, I was defined as a very nice guy, intelligent and also very kind and patience. I don,t have problems with people generally and I am very tolerated with dificults situations.</p>

            <p>As hobbys, I like to do kart-racing sometimes, watch the F1 season, play computer games and repair a lot of stuff in home, because I´m an electronic technician.</p>

            <p>I hope you can have some good time in my website and I am avaible for whatever you need.</p>

            <p>Thanks for whatching. Lucas</p>
